README for gfs/oss/gcc
=============================================================================

This directory contains the official GCC binaries used to build distributed
AMPS releases. Beginning with AMPS 4.3.2.0 we build our own GCC so that we can
control the support matrix for the AMPS binaries. These GCC binaries differ
from a standard Linux distribution's binaries only in that GCC itself was
compiled on a very old Linux distribution, such that GCC wouldn't auto-detect
binutils features from newer distributions that don't exist on the old side of
our support matrix.

To build a new GCC for this directory follow these steps:

1. Identify the oldest RedHat/CentOS version we want to support.
2. Install that RedHat/CentOS version on a new virtual machine.
3. Download the desired GCC tarball, unpack, and build GCC on that virtual
   machine.

   a. Note that GCC may or may not build out-of-the-box on your oldest desired
      distribution. You can choose to hack things to make it build, or
      pick a newer RedHat/CentOS version, hoping that the GCC you build emits
      binaries that happen to work on the low end of your target matrix.
      (For GCC 4.9.3., I chose the latter, building GCC on CentOS 5.0, which
      results in a GCC that produces binaries that work on CentOS 4.8,
      determined by testing.)
   b. See the blog post on "Breaking the Chains of Version Dependency" for
      handy tips if you've never built GCC yourself. It takes a few steps.

4. Copy over the GCC destination directory to GFS. I'm unable to safely
   determine a "minimal subset" of GCC, so this is the whole destination tree.


Here's a table of gcc version along with what OS the GCC was built on and the
earliest OS we support with that GCC. Please keep it up to date.
